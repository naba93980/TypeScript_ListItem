**********my personal note for identifying MVVM pattern**************

MVVM :

model => localStorage data
listTemplate.js => template => view => template compiles to view
fullList.ts & listItems.ts => component => viewModel


this project uses two way binding...once a item is added, the model(data) in local storage is updated which triggers re-render
